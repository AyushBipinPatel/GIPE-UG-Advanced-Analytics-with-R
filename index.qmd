## Learning Objective

The ultimate aim of this course is to provide a gentle introduction to statistical learning techniques. I aim to expose the learners to a wide variety of techniques.^[There is a trade off here. Given the time constraint of 40 teaching hours and the choice of exposing to a wide variety of techniques, I can afford only a reasonable amount of depth to each topic.] 

After successful completion of this course, a learner will have foundational understanding of statistical learning techniques, when to apply a given technique and how to use R to apply these techniques.

## Pre-requisite

If you can comfortably understand the following code and are fairly confidant about the functions used in the code, you most likely have the necessary R programming skills to absorb the materials covered in this course.

```{r pre-req}
#| eval: false

## read data on disk and store as an object

data <- read_csv("file location/fil.csv")

## Data Wrangling

data %>% 
  filter(semister == 5) %>% 
  group_by(division) %>% 
  summarise(
    avg_attend = mean(attend, na.rm = T),
    max_score = max(score, na.rm = T)
  )

```

In case you are having difficulty in guessing what the above piece of code does, __[Please read the Chapter 5 of R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html)__

Following are the programming techniques that are _not required_ for this course but are highly useful and will make learning experience easier:

  + Iterations
  + Writing custom functions
  + Data Visualization
  
## Teaching Material

Here are links to lecture slides, this will keep updating. Please visit this page before every lecture to gain access to lecture slides.^[The slides will be uploaded a day before or on the day of the lecture.]

  + Refresher: [Introduction to R](https://ayushbipinpatel.github.io/R-for-Data-Analysis/introduction-to-r.html#1)
  + Refresher: Data Wrangling
  

## Announcements

Here you will find any important Announcements regarding the course.

  + The Lecture scheduled on the 16th of Aug has been delayed by an hour for __Division 2__ _only_. This means that the lecture will start at 11:45 am.
